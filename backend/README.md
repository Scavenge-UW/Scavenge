# Backend
The backend uses a combination of the `routes`, `models`, and `controllers` folders. It handles interactions with our web server and database.

The `routes` folder holds the routes that users may target. A route is just a url such as "localhost:8080/testRoute". The four types of requests that could be made by a user are "GET", "POST", "PUT", and "DELETE". Once a route is hit, a method in the `controllers` folder will simply be called.

The `controllers` folder includes all of the functions that are called by the `routes` folder. Each function in this folder may interact with the database using functions defined in the `models` folder. They should also specify what should be returned to the frontend after receiving data from the database. The convention is to end each method name in the `controllers` with "Action" e.g. "getMenuAction". The controller call specific queries from the `models` to form an action.

The `models` folder includes all of the functions that are called by the `controllers` folder. Each function in this folder is simply a query. They will use prepared statements to prevent SQL injections.

Run BE tests: "npm run test" (server needs to be off as well).

Template for a function in the models
```
exports.deleteFood = (req, res) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Connect to database
    pool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
      const query = `
        // query here
      `;
      connection.query(query, (error, rows, fields) => {
        // Always release the connection back
        connection.release();
      });
    });
  });
}
```

The `middleware` folder includes functions that will be called by the `routes` folder. An example of a middleware function is something that checks if the user is signed in or not.
