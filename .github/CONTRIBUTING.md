- Raise an issue for tasks that you are working on and link the PR to the task
- Please work in your own branch and make a PR when ready.
- Have at least 1 person (preferably your leader) review your code if you implemented a feature.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or look things up that you are confused about :)
